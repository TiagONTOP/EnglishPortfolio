# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science portfolio! Here, you will find a collection of model implementations and data analyses done using Python files, Jupyter notebooks, and Excel. Each project is carefully annotated to provide you with a deep understanding of the methods and results.

## Portfolio Structure

The portfolio is structured into three main folders to facilitate navigation and searching for topics of interest. Here is the structure you will find:

1. **Excel Files and Explanatory Notes**
   - This folder contains Excel files accompanied by their respective explanatory notes. Each file is annotated and explained in detail.

2. **Finance-Specific Data Analysis**
   - This folder is dedicated to the analysis of finance-specific data. You will find various projects and analyses done using Python and Jupyter notebooks.

3. **Miscellaneous Projects**
   - This folder contains a variety of data science projects. Whether they are notebooks or .py files, each one is accompanied by markdown explanations or an associated "readme" file.

## Using the Files

The files contained in this portfolio are freely accessible. You are encouraged to explore, use, and adapt them to your needs. I recommend reading the provided annotations to gain a better understanding of the code and techniques used.

## Note

Please note that this portfolio represents my work up until the date of its last update. I continue to learn, develop my skills, and explore new technologies and methods in Data Science. Therefore, feel free to check back regularly for new projects and updates.

Thank you for visiting my Data Science portfolio! I hope you find the information and accomplishments presented here interesting and inspiring. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Happy exploring!
